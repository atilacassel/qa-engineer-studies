## Project Overview

In this study project, we will focus on the following key areas:

1. **JavaScript**: Understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript and how it can be utilized for QA testing.

2. **TypeScript (TS)**: Exploring TypeScript to leverage strong typing and improved code maintainability in our test scripts.


3.  **Mocha**: Gaining proficiency in Mocha as a versatile testing framework for both frontend and backend testing.

4. **Jest**: Mastering the Jest testing framework for writing robust and maintainable unit and integration tests.

Feel free to explore each section to dive deeper into these topics.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a fundamental programming language for web development and automation testing. Here, we will cover JavaScript basics, best practices, and its application in QA automation.

## TypeScript (TS)

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that offers enhanced code quality and maintainability. We will explore TypeScript and how it can be used effectively in QA testing.

## Mocha

Mocha is a versatile JavaScript testing framework often used for both frontend and backend testing. We'll explore Mocha's features and its integration with other testing libraries.

## Jest

Jest is a widely-used JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. We'll delve into Jest's capabilities for writing unit and integration tests with ease.
